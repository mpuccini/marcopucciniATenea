### M.I.A. Fashion
M.I.A. Fashion ([link in italian](https://ict.enea.it/mia/)), Models and Solutions for Artificial Intelligence in the Luxury Fashion sector, is a project that aims to design and develop an **ICT platform** to support business of an importat luxury fashion company. The final objective of the project is to create a hybrid digital ecosystem, identifying the right technological trade-off that allows to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by the technical-scientific innovation related to **artificial intelligence** systems aiming to:

* a better *satisfaction* of consumer's expectations
* an *improvement* of sales channels
* a *growth* of touch points with customers
* developing *predictive analysis* on consumer behavior during the purchase phase
* developing a *guiding function* in the strategies for the supply of products and services
* develop *analyses* aimed at supporting the creative and productive area of the Company
* develop *security systems* that guarantee the correct use of information data, avoiding external threats
							
In particular i'm working on design and build up the backend for collecting, storing and makes available data from social networks to Deep Learning models. Technologies adopted are, in the first instance, mongoDB for metadata storing and GPFS ([IBM Spectrum](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/storage/spectrum)) as distribuited file system, while [Ceph](https://ceph.io/) is in testing.
