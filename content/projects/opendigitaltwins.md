The ENEA **Open DigitalTwins** is a digital ecosystem to manage etherogeneus data from the Cultural Heritage and Heritage Science. The main characteristic is his software architecture, based on microservices. 

#### General info
This is an experimental activity to design and develop a moderncloud native architecture able to reach this needs.  The cloud native properties indeed leads to **scalability** and **portability**. One other argument is the *openess* of this architecture.  That means not only with regard to theused open source softwares, but also to the open and collaborative developing process based ongit hosting platforms for source versioning and sharing.  At least but not last, there is the effort to open data in a [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) sense. The result want to be an **open software tool** easy to deploy in a private, public or even hybrid cloud, managed by the assets owner itself, designed to be a distributed standard that allow data communication from one node to another.
